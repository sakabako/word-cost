# Word Cost

This tool calculates how hard it is to type a word. It takes into account how far your fingers need to move to type a key, which hand is used to type a letter, how long words are, and repeated letters.

Right now the word "service" is hard coded, but it may be expanded.


Ideally it would use the scoring system from this paper:
